- Support for '-' filename for STDIN?
- Calculate total statistics and display percentage for all values?
- We can also calculate connection speed based on size and time
- Parse log based on arguments passed to the constructor
- Print filename (and line?) for log parsing errors
- Try to use borrowed str object in HTTPLogRecord
- Should we decode path? For example /" will be replaced with /\x22 in the log
- Can we store the whole owned log line in the HTTPLogRecord and borrow all the
  parts from it?
