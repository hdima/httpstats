- Proper error reporting for GzipReader
- Create proper URLs by adding domain to paths in the request by paths list
    - Probably we also need to store if request is HTTP or HTTPS to create
      proper URLs?
- Display statistics for some strange cases like unknown HTTP methods etc.?
- Configure text width through the command line options? Also we can try to
  guess the width for the terminal
- Maybe print top of pages for other statuses than 200?
- Print clients by response time and response size?
- Display percentage for all values?
- Parse log based on arguments passed to the constructor
- Print filename (and line?) for log parsing errors? Probably not easy since
  we use merged reader.
- Should we decode path? For example /" will be replaced with /\x22 in the log
- What should we do with empty fields which marked as "-" in the log? Should
  they be converted to an empty string or should we use Option instead?

- Tests

Maybe
=====

- Support for '-' filename for STDIN?
- We can also calculate connection speed based on size and time
