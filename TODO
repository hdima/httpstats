- Support for '-' filename for STDIN?
- Calculate total statistics and display percentage for all values?
- We can also calculate connection speed based on size and time
- Parse log based on arguments passed to the constructor
- Print filename (and line?) for log parsing errors
- Try to use borrowed str object in HTTPLogRecord
- It seems if request path is too long we just get the first part of the
  request in the log up to the size limit. For example: "HEAD /long-long-path"
