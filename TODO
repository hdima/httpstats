- Support for .gz
- Parse log based on arguments passed to the constructor
- Print filename (and line?) for log parsing errors? Probably not easy since
  we use merged reader.
- Should we decode path? For example /" will be replaced with /\x22 in the log
- What should we do with empty fields which marked as "-" in the log? Should
  they be converted to an empty string or should we use Option instead?
- Configure items limit from command line?
- Comments
- Tests

Maybe
=====

- Support for '-' filename for STDIN?
- Calculate total statistics and display percentage for all values?
- We can also calculate connection speed based on size and time
