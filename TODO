- Support for '-' filename for STDIN?
- Calculate total statistics and display percentage for all values?
- We can also calculate connection speed based on size and time
- Parse log based on arguments passed to the constructor
- Print filename (and line?) for log parsing errors? Probably not easy since
  we use merged reader.
- Should we decode path? For example /" will be replaced with /\x22 in the log
- Replace next() method with something like process(stats)? In this case we can
  easily use borrowed substrings in HTTPLogRecord.
