- Support for '-' filename for STDIN?
- Calculate total statistics and display percentage for all values?
- We can also calculate connection speed based on size and time
- Parse log based on arguments passed to the constructor
- Print filename (and line?) for log parsing errors? Probably not easy since
  we use merged reader.
- Should we decode path? For example /" will be replaced with /\x22 in the log
- Move format_duration() and format_bytes() functions to an utils module
